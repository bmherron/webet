# We.Bet

We.Bet is an app that allows users to share a social experience that revolves around prop bets.

# Mission Statement

Our lives are lived in moments. We.bet looks to glorify the fun and fleeting moments friends share around a friendly wager. Humanity expose its true heart when good friends make low stakes bets: we are courageous; we are intelligent; we are willing to dive into uncertainty and be irrational. We do this together and at odds all at once. That’s an amazing way to make true connections, and every decision We.bet makes should revolve around putting that bond to another into the palm of anyone’s hand.
